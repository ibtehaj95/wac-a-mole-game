# wac-a-mole-game
Tried making a copy of the retro-game called Wac-a-Mole. Play it at https://ibtehajdoesdevelopment.on.drv.tw/webdev/games/wac-a-mole/.

The game can also be enjoyed on most phones (tested on Firefox and Chrome).

This game was a part of the tutorial course given by Ania Kubow on the Free Code Camp YouTube channel.
